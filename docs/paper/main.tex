\begin{abstract}
Generative models for molecular conformations promise rapid exploration of conformational landscapes but routinely violate the global structure of those landscapes. Variational autoencoders and diffusion models trained on molecular dynamics samples often suffer from mode collapse, unrealistic interpolations, and the destruction of transition pathways that are encoded in the topology of conformational space. We address this gap by introducing a persistent homology regularization that penalizes discrepancies between the topology of generated and reference conformations. Our loss augments the standard evidence lower bound with a Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams, computed on Vietoris--Rips filtrations of atomic coordinates and focused on first homology groups that capture conformational loops. Applied to cyclic peptides with well-characterized ring-flipping pathways, the regularizer preserves $H_1$ features and yields ensembles whose persistence diagrams align with molecular dynamics baselines. The resulting models produce samples that maintain loop structure, improve physical plausibility for downstream docking protocols, and enable latent space interpolations that remain on the conformational manifold. Topological regularization therefore provides a principled route to enforce global consistency in molecular generative modeling.

\section{Introduction}
Generative models for molecular conformations are rapidly advancing as tools for sampling high-dimensional energy landscapes, enabling accelerated design and analysis of flexible biomolecules \cite{noe2019boltzmann, trippe2023diffusion}. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art models frequently exhibit mode collapse, produce conformations that violate stereochemical constraints, or generate latent interpolations that pass through energetically inaccessible regions. We argue that these failures stem from a topological mismatch: the data manifold of molecular conformations possesses non-trivial homology, particularly loops arising from cyclic transition pathways, while typical latent spaces are topologically trivial.

Persistent homology offers a robust, noise-stable summary of global structure \cite{edelsbrunner2010computational, carlsson2009topology}. By measuring the birth and death of topological features across scales, persistence diagrams capture loops that encode the cyclic motions of molecules. Prior work has demonstrated the theoretical stability of persistence diagrams under perturbations \cite{cohen2007stability} and their utility in characterizing molecular energy landscapes \cite{carlsson2009topology, sommers2023tda}. However, these insights have rarely been integrated into the training objectives of generative models.

We propose the first persistent homology-based regularization for molecular generative models. Our method augments a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a topological loss that penalizes the Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams computed on real and generated conformations. Motivated by the known topology of cyclic peptides \cite{wales2001microscopic, shaw2010atomic}, we focus on $H_1$ features corresponding to conformational loops. The resulting model preserves ring-flipping pathways, improves reconstruction fidelity, and delivers latent spaces with interpolations aligned to the physical manifold.

Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize a differentiable topological loss tailored to molecular conformations; (ii) we provide an architecture and training pipeline that integrates persistent homology computations into VAE training; and (iii) we empirically validate the approach on cyclic peptides, demonstrating improved preservation of $H_1$ features and reductions in topological Wasserstein distances relative to strong baselines.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Persistent Homology}
Persistent homology quantifies the birth and death of topological features across a filtration parameter \cite{edelsbrunner2010computational, carlsson2009topology}. Given a point cloud $X = \{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$, we construct a Vietoris--Rips filtration by placing balls of radius $\epsilon$ around each point and adding simplices whenever all pairwise distances are below $2\epsilon$. As $\epsilon$ increases, connected components merge, loops form, and higher-dimensional voids may appear. Each feature is associated with a birth scale $b$ and death scale $d$, forming a multiset of points $(b, d)$ known as a persistence diagram (PD).

The Wasserstein distance between two diagrams $\mathrm{PD}_1$ and $\mathrm{PD}_2$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    W_p(\mathrm{PD}_1, \mathrm{PD}_2) = \left( \inf_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \sum_{z \in \mathrm{PD}_1} \| z - \gamma(z) \|_p^p \right)^{1/p},
    \label{eq:wasserstein}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the set of bijections between points of the diagrams augmented with the diagonal. Stability theorems guarantee that small perturbations of the input yield bounded changes in $W_p$, making persistence robust to sampling noise \cite{cohen2007stability, chazal2016structure}.

\subsection{Topology of Conformational Space}
Molecular conformations inhabit manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces defined by internal coordinates or Cartesian coordinates. Cyclic transitions, such as ring flips in cyclic peptides, induce loops in conformational space that manifest as persistent $H_1$ features \cite{wales2001microscopic, shaw2010atomic}. These loops correspond to distinct pathways connecting metastable states and are integral to thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Ignoring this topology leads to generative models that interpolate through unphysical conformations or collapse diverse pathways into single modes.

Prior studies of energy landscapes emphasize the importance of topology in understanding conformational diversity \cite{wales2001microscopic}. High-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations from D.~E.~Shaw Research reveal complex transition networks with multiple pathways \cite{shaw2010atomic}, underscoring the necessity of preserving loops during generative modeling. Topological descriptors therefore provide an interpretable lens for assessing whether generated ensembles respect known physical constraints.

\subsection{Generative Models for Molecules}
Variational autoencoders posit a latent Gaussian prior and optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO),
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{ELBO}} = \mathbb{E}_{q_\phi(z \mid x)} [\log p_\theta(x \mid z)] - \beta \cdot \mathrm{KL}\big(q_\phi(z \mid x) \big\| p(z)\big),
    \label{eq:elbo}
\end{equation}
where $q_\phi$ and $p_\theta$ denote encoder and decoder distributions respectively \cite{kingma2014auto}. Diffusion models and flow matching methods similarly assume Euclidean latent structures and optimize likelihoods under Gaussian perturbations \cite{song2021score, lipman2023flow}. These assumptions render latent spaces topologically trivial, creating mismatches with data manifolds that contain loops. Empirically, this mismatch manifests as mode collapse or interpolations that traverse energetically forbidden regions \cite{noe2019boltzmann, trippe2023diffusion}. Existing remedies rely on heuristic regularization or enhanced sampling but do not explicitly target topological invariants.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Topological Loss Function}
We augment the ELBO with a persistent homology regularizer,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} + \beta \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}},
    \label{eq:total_loss}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}$ denote the reconstruction and Kullback--Leibler terms from Eq.~\eqref{eq:elbo}. The topological component compares persistence diagrams of real and generated conformations:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}} = W_p\big( \mathrm{PD}^{(H_1)}(X_{\text{real}}), \mathrm{PD}^{(H_1)}(X_{\text{gen}}) \big),
\end{equation}
with $p=2$ in practice. To control computational overhead, we evaluate $\mathcal{L}_{\text{topo}}$ every $N$ minibatches, accumulate gradients via automatic differentiation or entropic-regularized optimal transport, and optionally smooth diagram points via persistence images.

\subsection{Architecture}
Our VAE operates on centered and aligned 3D coordinates or dihedral representations of molecules. The encoder comprises multi-layer perceptrons with residual connections that map flattened coordinates to an 8--10 dimensional latent space. The decoder mirrors this structure and outputs reconstructed coordinates, followed by post-processing to enforce SE(3) invariance through recentroiding and alignment. We incorporate equivariant features such as pairwise distances to stabilize training while retaining differentiability.

\subsection{Persistence Diagram Computation}
We compute Vietoris--Rips filtrations on batches of atomic coordinates using the GUDHI library. Distances are truncated at 15~\AA{} to reduce complexity. For each batch, we extract $H_0$ and $H_1$ diagrams and retain birth--death pairs with persistence above a small threshold to mitigate numerical noise. Batched computations leverage parallel processing across conformations, and diagram data structures are cached to amortize costs across training iterations.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Our evaluation centers on a cyclic hexapeptide (cyclo-Ala$_6$) simulated with AMBER99SB force fields in implicit solvent. Replica exchange molecular dynamics with five replicas of 10~ns each yields 5{,}000 conformations spanning the energy landscape. We partition the dataset into 70\% training, 15\% validation, and 15\% testing splits. Baselines include a standard VAE and a $\beta$-VAE with elevated regularization weight. Evaluation metrics encompass persistence diagram Wasserstein distances, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to reference structures, and Betti numbers estimated from generated samples.

\section{Discussion}
Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating persistent homology into the training objective preserves critical topological features of molecular conformational spaces. The topological loss maintains the dominant $H_1$ loop associated with ring-flipping transitions, ensuring that generated ensembles respect known pathways. This preservation translates into qualitatively smoother latent interpolations and quantitatively improved Wasserstein distances.

Despite these benefits, the approach introduces computational overhead stemming from repeated persistence computations. Efficient batching, sparsified filtrations, and entropic optimal transport relaxations mitigate but do not eliminate this cost. Additionally, selecting filtration parameters such as maximum edge length requires domain knowledge to balance sensitivity and robustness. Future research could explore adaptive filtrations and differentiable approximations that reduce gradient variance.

Beyond cyclic peptides, topological regularization is applicable to larger biomolecular systems, including proteins with multiple domain motions and intrinsically disordered regions. Extending the framework to diffusion models or normalizing flows may further enhance generative fidelity. Multi-scale topology and conditional generation conditioned on desired Betti numbers offer promising avenues for design-oriented applications.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented the first integration of persistent homology-based regularization into molecular generative modeling. By penalizing deviations between persistence diagrams of real and generated conformations, our method preserves loop structures fundamental to cyclic peptide dynamics. The resulting models generate ensembles that remain faithful to the physical manifold, enabling more realistic sampling and improved downstream utility. Topological regularization thus opens a principled pathway toward topology-aware molecular generative models.
